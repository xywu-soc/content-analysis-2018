    "# Week 2 - Corpus Linguistics\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we take text corpora that we have developed, spidered, scraped, and encoded, and we find and count words and simple phrases and properties of those counts (e.g., word frequency distributions). Initially, we model how to search corpora for keywords or phrases. Next, we examine the distributions of terms and phrases across a corpus, and the corelation between different words and phrase counts. In order to do this effectively, we coarsely disambiguate words based of part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and normalize them through stemming and lemmatization. Next we distinguish *important* words and phrase within the corpus, and image them with Wordls! Then we calculate word frequenceis, conditional frequences (the frequency of word *shock* conditional on the presence of word *awe*), and statistically significant collocations of lengths 2 through $n$. Finally, we calculate and visualize Differences (Divergences and Distances) between the word frequency distributions from two corpora. \n",

    "This shows that likelihood of a word occurring is inversely proportional to its rank. This effect is called [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law), and suggests that the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc. Zipf's law is most easily observed by plotting the data on a log-log graph, with the axes being log (rank order) and log (frequency) resulting in a linear relationship."

      "   Whitehouse met Lila two weeks ago. She was diagnosed two years ago with osteosarcoma, a cancerous bone condition, and last year underwent cadaver bone transplant surgery. The procedure saved her leg and is helping her remain cancer-free, but the transplanted tissue will not grow with her and likely will break down over time. Stem cell research, Whitehouse explained, could vastly improve the care of patients like Lila by allowing surgeons to enhance transplants with a patient's own stem cells, which could replace the lost bone and cartilage, or grow entirely new replacement bones and joints. \n",

While it's better than `.split(' ')`, a general python string method that splits on whitespace, it is not perfect. There are many different ways to tokenize a string. `word_tokenize` is unfortunately unaware of sentences and is essentially a complicated regular expression (regex) run across the string.\n",

Recall that $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\|Q)$ measures the amount of information loss when $Q$ is used to approximate $P$. Here, the rows are the $P$s used for calculating KL divergences, and the columns are the $Q$s. So, each cell measures the amount of information loss when the word distribution of the column text is used to approximate the word distribution of the row text. Because the KL divergence is directional, such that the divergence of $P$ from $Q$ is different from the same of $Q$ from $P$, the matrix is assymetric and contains unique information above and below the diagonal. The same is true for the $\\chi^2$ divergence."
